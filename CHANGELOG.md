Improve READMEs, documentation and the example project.

## 0.1.1

### `WeekdaySelector` widget

* **internationalization-friendly**: change texts, directionality, and first day of the week
* **highly-customizable**: customize colors, text styles, elevations, and shapes
* **sane defaults**: colors are picked based on your material theme

### Theming with `WeekdaySelectorTheme`

The weekday selector provides its own inherited widget which you can use if you want to customize multiple weekday selectors in your subtree.

### Example app, testing

The initial version of the example app is added to the project. We improved the automated test suite, and execute checks on every commit to master to ensure good quality.
